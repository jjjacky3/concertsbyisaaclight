# Project Description and Motivation
OnlyConcerts is a web application that aims to revolutionize how concert-goers decide to attend live music events. Inspired by how RateMyProfessor impacted academic course selection, our application will be a one-stop platform where users can access and contribute detailed concert reviews, ratings, and comprehensive tour info (venues, prices, transportation, and more). 
The motivation for this project stems from the challenges in the concert industry. Ticket prices have skyrocketed(thanks to social media and scalpers). The cost is more substantial when one considers transportation and time commitment. Our team wants to ensure that we and other concert-goers feel confident in their purchases. However, there is no consolidated platform where users can access comprehensive reviews and details about touring artists' performances, making it difficult to make informed decisions about concert attendance.
